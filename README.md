# Hi, welcome to my page!
## My name is Philip Cole, and I am studying Human Systems Engineering with a focus on User Experience through an ASU.Online University program. I currently hold a BS in Business Administration, and I ran my own business for 17 years building and restoring professional quality level violins, violas, and cellos. My family's background is in classical music and the arts.
## I am currently working full time for a medical device company, where the focus is also on quality and reliability of the product.
## My goal is to help improve the development of products and systems, and the overall quality of people's lives. I would be interested in working as a Human Factor's Engineer, UX designer, or consultant.
## If you'd like to meet or just want to support my efforts, consider buying me a coffee:
