      <p>Hi, welcome to my page!
 My name is Philip Cole, and I am studying Human Systems Engineering with a focus on User Experience through an ASU.Online University program. I currently hold a BS in Business Administration, and have run my own business for 17 years building and restoring professional quality level violins, violas, and cellos. My family's background is in classical music and the arts.

 I am currently working full time for a medical device company, where the focus is also on quality and reliability. My aim is to help improve the development of products and systems. I would be interested in working as a Human Factor's Engineer, UX designer, or consultant.
 
 Feel free to buy me a coffee, if you find my work interesting:
